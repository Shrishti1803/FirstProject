This project is just a basic application of connecting the c++ code with MYSQL DB. 
The project is like a management system for a makup or cosmetics company  where I am using the MYSQL DB for storing data about the products and suppliers and c++ for the functions.
Next step in the project is to make it more UI based and take user input. Basic idea would be that the user gets to interact with the main menu for switing to various functions and interact with the already present data in the DB about the Products, being able to add it to the cart.
The User data would again be stored in another table in the DB. 
Right now the Basic aim is to learn about SQL connectivity to the c++ code, which include creating, updating, inserting, reading and deleting data from the tbale in DB as per the requirements. 
Currently, done with the Product details and Supplier details. 
I have alos attached the basic snippet of establishing the connection between the mysql DB and my c++ code for my reference.
